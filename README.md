# PassGen (Password generator)


The password generator is a versatile tool that allows you to create secure and customized passwords quickly and easily. With the ability to select the desired language, the generator provides a personalized experience for users from different regions and languages.

This password generator offers three types of passwords:

1. Normal (Generates letters only Level: Not very efficient):
This level of password strength generates passwords that consist solely of letters, both uppercase and lowercase. While these passwords provide some basic security, they are not as robust as those incorporating numbers and special characters. They are suitable for accounts where the security requirements are not very high or for users who prefer simpler passwords.

2. High (Generates letters and numbers Level: Efficient):
This level of password strength generates passwords that include both letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and numbers. Combining letters and numbers enhances the security of the password significantly, making it more resistant to brute force attacks. These passwords are efficient for most online accounts and provide a good balance between security and ease of use.

3. Elevated (Generates letters, numbers, and special characters Level: Very High):
This level of password strength generates passwords that include letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters such as !, @, #, $, etc. Adding special characters further increases the complexity and strength of the password, making it highly resistant to various types of attacks. These passwords are recommended for accounts that require maximum security, such as online banking or sensitive personal data storage.
